Project Overview: Predicting Sales with Simple Linear Regression

In a recent project during my supervised internship at CodeAloha, I developed a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on marketing expenditures across different platforms using Python. This work was supervised by @codealoha.

Key Steps:

Performed data exploration and cleaning to ensure data quality.
Visualized relationships between sales and various advertising channels.
Built and evaluated a model, identifying TV advertising as the most correlated predictor with sales.
Results:

The model explains approximately 83.9% of the variance in sales.
There is a statistically significant positive relationship between TV advertising spend and sales.
The model was validated on test data, demonstrating satisfactory performance metrics.
Tools Used: Pandas, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib.

This project provided data-driven insights into the relationship between advertising spend and sales
