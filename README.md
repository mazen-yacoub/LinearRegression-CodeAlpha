Project Overview: Predicting Sales with Simple Linear Regression

I was working on a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on marketing expenditures across different platforms using Python. This work was supervised by @codealpha.

Key Steps:
- Performed data exploration and cleaning to ensure data quality.
- Visualized relationships between sales and various advertising channels.
- Built and evaluated a model, identifying TV advertising as the most correlated predictor with sales.
Results:

-The model explains approximately 83.9% of the variance in sales.
-There is a statistically significant positive relationship between TV advertising spend and sales.
-The  model was validated on test data, demonstrating satisfactory performance metrics.

Libraries Used: Pandas, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and Matplotlib.
This project provided data-driven insights into the relationship between advertising spend and sales
